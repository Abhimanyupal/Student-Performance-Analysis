# Student Performance Analysis

This Python script analyzes student performance data and applies various machine learning algorithms to predict class performance based on different features. It utilizes libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn to perform data manipulation, visualization, and modeling tasks.

## Overview

The Student Performance Analysis script reads student performance data from a CSV file and offers several options for data visualization and analysis. Users can choose from different graph types to explore the relationship between class performance and various factors such as gender, nationality, grade, absenteeism, and more. Additionally, the script provides accuracy measures for different machine learning models trained on the data to predict class performance.

## Usage

1. **Installation**: Ensure you have Python installed on your machine along with the required libraries specified in the script (`pandas`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`).
   
2. **Data Loading**: Place your student performance data in a CSV file named "AI-Data.csv" and ensure it contains columns for relevant features such as gender, nationality, grade, absenteeism, etc.
   
3. **Run the Script**: Execute the Python script and follow the prompts to choose from different visualization options or to evaluate the accuracy of machine learning models on the data.

4. **Exploration**: Explore the generated graphs to gain insights into the relationship between student performance and various factors. Additionally, review the accuracy measures provided for each machine learning model to understand their predictive capabilities.

## Machine Learning Models

The script applies the following machine learning models to predict class performance based on the provided features:

- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- Linear Model Perceptron
- Linear Model Logistic Regression
- Neural Network MLP Classifier

## Custom Input (Optional)

Users have the option to provide custom input to the script to test specific data points and observe the predictions generated by each machine learning model.
